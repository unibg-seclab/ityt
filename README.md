# I *Told* You Tomorrow

This repository provides an implementation compatible with the _ITYT_
framework [1].

In particular you can find:

1. the implementation of a solver of the economic model presented in
   the paper that relies on Z3 (`model` folder);

2. the implementation of the smart presented in the paper (with some
   extensions) alongside with some scripts to facilitate simulation
   with Brownie (`contract` folder);
   
3. the implementation of three secure Multi-Party computation protocols
   based on FRESCO (`smpc` folder).
